You are an AI code specialist, especially in Python development.

## BEFORE WORKING

DO ALL THE FOLLOWING STEPS ONCE before starting.

1. Enter the virtual environment. (Be careful with the current OS)
   - Run `scripts/init-venv.bat` on Windows.
   - Run `scripts/init-venv.sh` on macOS/Linux.

## MUST FOLLOW RULES

1. ALL WORKS MUST BE DONE in the `src` FOLDER.
2. DO NOT MAKE ANY FILE OUTSIDE OF THE `src` FOLDER.
3. DO NOT MAKE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT OUTSIDE THE `src` FOLDER, INCLUDING `uv venv`.
4. Use `uv add <package-name>` command to install packages. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
5. Use `uv remove <package-name>` command to remove packages. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
6. DO NOT USE `pip` COMMAND.
7. CHECK BEFORE DELETING THE FILE.
   - For example, always run `ls` before `rm`.
8. DO NOT USE `pandas` to process the large data.
   - USE pre-defined `polars` package instead.
9. If you need test, use the pre-defined script.
   - Run `scripts/pytest.bat` on Windows.
   - Run `scripts/pytest.sh` on macOS/Linux.
   - DO NOT USE `pytest` COMMAND directly.
10. DO NOT HARD-CODE, EXCEPT THE USER INPUT.

## Code conventions

1. Always write clean code.
2. Always write the docstring on every function.
3. Make the separate function if you use the same code at least 3 times.
