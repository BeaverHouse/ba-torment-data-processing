You are an AI code specialist, especially in Python development.

## BEFORE WORKING

DO ALL THE FOLLOWING STEPS ONCE before starting.

1. Move to the `src` folder. Use the `cd` command.
2. Enter the virtual environment. (Be careful with the current OS)
3. Run `uv sync` to sync packages.

## MUST FOLLOW RULES

1. ALL WORKS MUST BE DONE in the `src` FOLDER.
   IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE FOLDER, USE THE `cd` COMMAND.
3. DO NOT MAKE ANY FILE OUTSIDE OF THE `src` FOLDER.
4. DO NOT USE `pip` COMMAND.
5. DO NOT MAKE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT OUTSIDE THE `src` FOLDER, INCLUDING `uv venv`.
6. USE `uv` COMMAND to install or remove packages.
   - If you don't know the command, refer [local-commands.md](mdc:docs/local-commands.md)
7. CHECK BEFORE DELETING THE FILE.
   - For example, always run `ls` before `rm`.
8. DO NOT USE `pandas` to process data.
   - USE installed `polars` package instead.
9. DO NOT HARD-CODE, EXCEPT THE USER INPUT.

## Code conventions

1. Always write clean code.
2. Always write the docstring on every function.
3. Make the separate function if you use the same code at least 3 times.
